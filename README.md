Documentation
-------------

There are a few places on the internet that offer `Clojure` documentation.

* [Official documentation][doc:official] The offical `Clojure` documentation. The resources would not be complete without it.
* [ClojureDocs][doc:clojuredoc] Community powered documentation for `Clojure`. For each function/macro there are some typical examples.
* [CDS][doc:cds] An other site dedicated to community powered documentation. Also has tutorials
